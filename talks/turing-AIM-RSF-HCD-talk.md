#### Title
RSF seminar series: Embedding human-centered design in the research setting

#### Presenter
Meag Doherty, Director, Research Experience
National Institutes of Health, *All of Us* Research Program

#### Who is it for?
A regular series of open invitation talks from leading voices in data science, AI, healthcare and those with lived experience dealing with multiple long-term conditions (MLTC). This seminar series is part of the AI for multiple long-term conditions: Research Support Facility project. Open to everyone across the AIM programme and the broader multiple long-term conditions research community, these talks are designed to share knowledge and stimulate discussion regarding AI and MLTC research.

#### About the event
In this talk, we will explore how human-centered design (HCD) processes can positively impact research study design and development. This talk will cover (1) the main components of HCD, (2) a case study of HCD at National Institutes of Health's *All of Us* Research Program, and (3) and a call for increasing awareness of HCD in research settings, and helpful tips to get started implementing HCD on your projects.

The *All of Us* Research Program is inviting one million or more people across the U.S. to help build one of the largest, most diverse health databases in history. By engaging the participation of people and communities who have been left out of medical research in the past and making their data available to diverse researchers across a wide range of  settings, the program seeks to improve understanding of health and disease and reduce health disparities.
